## pittie_bot
A small bot made with the singular purpose of posting cute dog pictures on discord.

### Usage
1. If you don't have a discord bot yet look up how to create one and be sure the following requirements are met.
The requirements for the bot are:
- `MESSAGE_CONTENT` intent enabled.
- `Send messages` permission
- `Attach files` permission

2. Once both the bot account on your server and an executable you can move the exe to what ever folder you want and run it, after which you should see two items appear which are: A folder called `images` and a file named `pittie_config.json`.
3. From the page you created your bot on copy the token and paste it inside the token filed in `pittie_config.json`.
4. Once all that is done you can go ahead and run the executable again and your bot should start working.
